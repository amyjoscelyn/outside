# Outside

A simple weather app of only a single screen, Outside simulates the view outside your window.  Right now, all it displays is the current apparent temperature and whether it feels colder or warmer than it should.

Soon a picture will be added based on the weather to really make it look like you're gazing outside your house to check the weather.

Forecast.io provides the weather data, and AFNetworking handles the API request.
